Anabot, the bot, Reborn
======

My first [bot](https://github.com/anaboth/Anabot) was just a fork from [telebot](https://github.com/yukuku/telebot) and both are unmaintained, my last commit was more than a year ago. So I decided to rewrite it from scratch to remove some limitations I used to had on the previous version, and because Javascript is better than Python ;P

> This bot is heavily inspired on [HyperNerd](https://github.com/tsoding/HyperNerd)
